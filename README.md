# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Traffic-sign recognition (TSR) is a technology by which a vehicle is able to recognize the traffic signs put on the road e.g. "speed limit" or "children" or "turn ahead". The technology is being developed by a variety of automotive suppliers. It uses image processing techniques to detect the traffic signs. The detection methods can be generally divided into color based, shape based and learning based methods.

Traffic signs provide important information for drivers about road condition and hazards. Their discriminating shape and colors make them easily recognizable by humans. Besides the application of Traffic sign recognition (TSR) in autonomous vehicles, it can also serve as an assistant driver (e.g. when combined with speedometer output) to notify the driver about approaching a traffic sign (e.g. even before driver sees it) or his risky behavior (like driving above the speed limit). Our motive is to identify “traffic signs” for the self-driving automated cars and further enhancing the detection techniques that currently prevail.

In this project, an improved traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm is proposed for intelligent vehicles. From the viewpoint of traffic sign recognition accuracy and algorithm time-consuming, the proposed traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm has remarkable advantages. Considerably enhancing the driving safety of intelligent vehicles in the actual driving environments and effectively meeting the real-time target requirements of smart cars are conducive. Furthermore, a strong technical guarantee is provided for the steady development of intelligent vehicle driving assistance. 

This project was done under the guidance of Prof. Manoj Kumar Mishra (KIIT University)
